# Investment-Data-Integrity-and-Reconciliation-Tool-with-a-Simple-Flask-UI-like-Mendix
This project simulates a data integrity and reconciliation process for investment portfolios, leveraging security master data from multiple sources (e.g., Bloomberg, ICE) to detect and resolve discrepancies. The project automates the reconciliation process, provides data integrity reports, and suggests improvements for managing data accuracy.
